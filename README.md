# an investment opportunity for eccentric billionaires

Dear fellow eccentric billionaires,

I have foreseen an investment opportunity in Bethnal Green, London, UK, Europe, The World, The Solar System, The Milky Way, The Local Cluster, The Local Supercluster, The Universe, The Multiverse, Reality!

There are gonna be **bare** good sites being made, specifically some [StackOverflow clones](https://github.com/FAC6/book/blob/master/projects/week5.md). I think we should all quickly snap up controlling shares in the various clones. Of course we won't by the shares with *money*! Money's for *billionaires*! Instead we will pay in Pivotal Tracker & client management training.

Suggested levels and forms of activity for eccentric billionaires:

* Contact your group once their product shows ***undeniable acquisition potential*** (probably after an hour or so of work)
* Make your offer (training in exchange for a controlling stake in the company). Do try and sell the prospect, but some groups may want to focus on other learning areas than client management. That is allowed.
* If the deal is accepted arrange a client meeting and prepare some outrageous expectations; link the group to pivotal tracker beforehand
* You should probably tell the group you only have ten minutes for a meeting. Schedule an hour. See how much pivotal processing you can get done. The rest can be continued 'remotely'.
* Perform reviews of the stories once a day. Leave unhelpful feedback but clarify when pressed. Use IE8.

Suggested eccentric billionaires:
* Jefferson Jefferson Jefferson Jr, heir to Jeffer Jefferson's Jeff fortune.
* Madame Tipple, an electrical goods magnate
* Sir Splat, a man who did a really big cool jumpy and a flippy and got knighted for it
* GEMIMA, an 'artistic mime entity and wannabe hivemind'

Do be any other eccentric billionaire that takes your fancy and have fun tormenting your investments!

Hugs and kisses,
Bettie Borgia (no relation)
